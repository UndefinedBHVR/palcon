# Palcon

**Attention!** This is a v0.1.\* version! Expect bugs and issues all around.
Submitting pull requests and issues is highly encouraged!

Palcon is a somewhat usable implementation of the RCON protocol for Palworld in Rust, designed with the weird quirks of Palworld in mind.
This does not work with other game servers to any reasonable extent, as Palworld breaks the rcon protocol in a few super annoying ways.

## Usage
Check the internal documentation within the `src/lib.rs` file. Its fairly simple.
